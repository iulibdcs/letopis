# Overview
The <i>Letopis' Zhurnal'nykh Statei</i> commenced publication in 1926, and covers more than 1,700 journals, series, and continuing publications of academies, universities, and research institutes in the fields of humanities, natural sciences, and the social sciences. It also covers the popular periodical literature. 

The Indiana University Libraries with funding from the U.S. Department of Education Technological Innovation and Cooperation for Foreign Information Access (TICFIA) Program transcribed and <a href="http://dlib.indiana.edu/collections/letopis">made available online tens of thousands of citations</a> in 2002 from the serial publication that covers Soviet-era periodicals from 1956 to 1975.  This period of the <i>Letopis' Zhurnal'nykh Statei</i> provides access to the periodical literature of an essential time in modern Russian history, beginning with the period of the Khrushchev "Thaw" following the 20th CPSU Congress and continuing through the first half of the so-called Brezhnev "Period of Stagnation". 

# Metadata
We have made the citations available in CSV format. The text is encoded in UTF-8 with BOM and each CSV file is compressed as a ZIP archive.  The citations were originally encoded in XML and are too large for GitHub.  If you prefer to work with XML directly, contact: Nick Homenda, nhomenda[at]indiana[dot].edu.
